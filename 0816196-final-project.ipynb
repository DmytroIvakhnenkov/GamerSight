      "The story follows the evil Witch King, also known as Lord of NazgÃ»l, and his road for domination. Unlike LOTR: Battle for middle earth 2, the campaign only expands through the evil campaign and The Witch King's rise over middle-earth and the fall of Arnor, instead of a good and a evil campaign. You will control Angmar, a new faction from the hills up north, and along the way you will meet different challenges, new units, buildings, locations and new heroes you never seen before in the films. That's because the story covers everything that happend after the defeat of lord Sauron, but before the films, where Gandalf visit the Hobbit Frodo in the Shire.\n",
